BondMatcher

1. Requiments

 - Python 2.7.x
 - numpy

2. Settings file.
The settings file has the same syntax as the ordinary Python code. In fact you can use every Python code there.

2.1 Atom definition
2.2 Bond definition
3.3. Angles, dihedrals, pairs definition
3.4 Other options

3. Bond constraints
3.1. Distance
3.2. Geometrical constraints
a) Cone
For each of the new bond type you can define the cone in which the new bond should fall in.
where operator can be '<' or '>'. The '<' meen that the bond vector has to be inside the cone, otherwise it will be outside.
The apex_point has to be also one of the points of the new bond.
The definition is as follow:
(apex_point, second_vector, inside_angle, operator)

b) Vector
This constraint allow to specifie the angle between two vectors. The two points that form new bond are also the part of those two vectors.
Definition:
(vec1_start, vec1_end, vec2_start, vec2_end, angle)
where the angle can be define both as the single value or as the range.

c) Align
Checks if two vectors points in the same direction. The two points of the new bond has to be also part of the checked vectors.

d) Sphere
This constraint checks if the new formed bond will cross the sphere around defined atoms. In order to use it, you have to define the radius in the atom definition. Also please notice that the constraint is only restricted to the molecules that are involved in forming the new bonds.
Definition:
For each of the bond type you can define the list of atoms that will have excluded volume.
